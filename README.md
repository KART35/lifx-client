lifx client
===========

playing around with the lifx api


Install
-------

```bash

npm install
gulp

```

lifx_token
----------

There are a  couple ideas floating in my head about how this should be
done in the future,but for now, save your token as `.lifx_token` in
your home dir using the following format:

```json

{ "token": "Your lifx token here" }

```
